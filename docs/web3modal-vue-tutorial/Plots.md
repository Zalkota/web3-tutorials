# Plot NFT
## Plot Of Land

:::warning Feature Under Construction ðŸ”¨
Plots of land are not redeemable until after the beta mode has ended. Beta mode will end once the Diamond Battle Pass NFT mint has ended.
:::

The current map of Blockforge, name the Island of Karniel, is 10,240 x 10,240 blocks in size.  
The map of Blockforge is evenly divided into 6,400 unique plots of land. A plot is defined as an area of 128x128 blocks. BlockForge users can purchase multiple territories to expand their empire within the Universe. These plots can be purchased with the use of $FORGE Tokens. Plots are stored as an ERC-721 token on the Ethereum Blockchain. Plots can be staked by the owner of the ERC721 can then modify the plot.

## Utility

<!-- The Battle Pass will have multiple functions: -->
* When staked, enables the owner to build on the plot.
* When staked, plots are rentable to anyone for a minimum of 7 days
* Enable [Battle Mode](/blockforge/Battle_mode) to generate $FORGE tokens, requires Battle Pass.



## Token Generation
Plots are given a rank number based on the amount of **Diamond Blocks** located on the plot. When the plot is staked and set to [Battle Mode](/blockforge/Battle_mode), then the plot will generate $FORGE tokens every hour, equal to the rank number multiplied by 2.
Players can increase the rank of their land by placing diamond blocks on their plot. Once a staked plot contains at least one block of diamond, then it can be set to [Battle Mode](/blockforge/Battle_mode) by the owner. When a staked plot is in Battle Mode, then it will generate $FORGE tokens for the owner.
