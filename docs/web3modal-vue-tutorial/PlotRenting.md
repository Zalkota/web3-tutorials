# Renting a Staked Plot

The Staked Diamond Plot has the ability to be rented out to any Ethereum wallet. When a Diamond Plot is staked, the Ethereum wallet will receive a Staked Diamond Plot in return. This can be transfered and sold on secondary to another Ethereum wallet for a minimum of 7 Days. After 7 days, the original owner of the Diamond Plot can retrieve the Staked Plot from the renter by using the **Revoke** function via the **Dashboard** or [Deployed Smart Contract](https://etherscan.io).
