### Introduction
 $FORGE is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum Blockchain that is used as the in-game currency for the Blockforge Universe. The purpose of the $FORGE token is to reward Blockforge Battle Pass Holders for their time and contribution to the society. The smart contract for $FORGE can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x807a0774236A0fBE9e7f8E7Df49EDFED0e6777Ea). The token will be scheduled for launch within the next few months for users to claim their rewards.


## Why Earn $FORGE ?

### Claim Plots
Earning $FORGE tokens will allow BlockForge Pass holders the ability to purchase plots of land within the Minecraft Server. Earning $FORGE tokens can be beneficial since there are only a limited amount of plots that can be purchased within the Minecraft Server.
### Block Fortifications
We have modified certain blocks to have increased strength and durability. Use these blocks to fortify your defense and protect your Diamond Blocks from raiders.
These blocks are redeemable with $Forge tokens from the blocksmith located inside BlockForge. Enter the main gate to BlockForge, travel down the stairs, first shop on the left. Speak with the NPC named **Dunstan**.

### Arenas
$FORGE Tokens can also be used to trade in-game items within the Blockforge Universe. The development team plans to implement an in-game marketplace where $FORGE tokens can be used to transact. $FORGE tokens will also be required to enter the following arenas:
* Forge Token Entrance fee to the **Resource Harvesting Arena**
* Wager Forge token at the **Dueling Arena**
* Pay Forge to obtain **Quests**
