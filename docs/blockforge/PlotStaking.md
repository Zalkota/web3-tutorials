# Staking Plot NFT

Stake your plot NFT to modify the plot in-game as the owner.

When a user stakes their Plot, the plot is transferred to a staking contract for safe storage and a new staked Plot is minted to the user.
When Battle Mode is active, the plot will generate $FORGE Tokens over time based on the amount of **Diamond Blocks** present on the plot. For more information see [Battle Mode](/blockforge/Battle_Mode.md)

:::warning Feature Under Construction ðŸ”¨
Plots are not stakable until after the beta mode has ended. Beta mode will end once the Diamond Battle Pass NFT mint has ended.

<!-- ## Battle Mode

When a plot is staked and set as vulnerable, users will be able to modify blocks from the staked plot.
Users are only able to modify the blocks of vulnerable plots, if they own at least one plot and set it as vulnerable.
Staked plots can only be set vulnerable, if they contain at least one block of diamond.
The token output per hour increments by +2 $FORGE tokens, per block of diamond, within a vulnerable plot.


 -->

<!-- Making a plot vulnerable also allows the plot owner to attack other vulnerable plots within the server for resources, especially Diamonds. -->
<!--
This game mechanism opens up a competitive player-vs-player environment for plot owners to increase their token generation by raiding other vulnerable plots for diamonds, which in turn can increase the amount of $FORGE tokens their plot generates. -->

<!-- Important points to keep in mind while staking a plot are: -->
<!-- We broke down the important takeaways here:

* If a plot is not staked, it is not modifiable in-game.

* If a plot is staked, it becomes modifiable by the verified owner.

* If a plot is staked and set as vulnerable by the owner, certain users are allowed to modify any blocks on the plot. See next point.

* Users are only able to modify vulnerable staked plots, if they themselves own at least one staked vulnerable plot.

* If a staked plot doesn't not contain any blocks of diamond, then it can not be made vulnerable.

* If a plot is staked and not set as vulnerable, it does not generate $FORGE Tokens.

* If a plot is staked and vulnerable, it can generate $FORGE tokens based off its rank.

* For each block of diamond located on the plot, the plot rank increments by 2.

* Rank is equal to the amount of $FORGE tokens it will generated per hour, if the plot is staked and set as vulnerable. -->
