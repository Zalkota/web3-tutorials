# Staking your Plot

Users have the ability to stake their plot NFT to enable building in-game. When a user stakes their Plot, the plot is transferred to a staking contract for safe storage and a new staked Plot is minted to the user.
A staked Plot can generates zero $FORGE tokens per day. Additional $FORGE Tokens can be generated based on the amount of “Diamond” present within the plot, but the plot must be vulnerable (see next section).

Renting a staked plot:
*  When a staked plot is sold or transferred to another Ethereum address, it can be retrieved to the original owner after 7-days.

* When a plot is staked, but **NOT** vulnerable then it will not generate $FORGE tokens.

<!-- * Total Plot Generation = Base Plot Generation + (No of Diamonds * 2 $FORGE/Diamond) -->

* When a plot is staked, it opens the staked plot up for Plot Vulnerability (Refer Next Section).

## Plot Vulnerability & Raiding

When a plot is staked and set as vulnerable, users will be able to modify blocks from the staked plot.
Users are only able to modify the blocks of vulnerable plots, if they own at least one plot and set it as vulnerable.
Staked plots can only be set vulnerable, if they contain at least one block of diamond.
The token output per hour increments by +2 $FORGE tokens, per block of diamond, within a vulnerable plot.

### Equation
<tokenEquation/>

<!-- Making a plot vulnerable also allows the plot owner to attack other vulnerable plots within the server for resources, especially Diamonds. -->

This game mechanism opens up a competitive player-vs-player environment for plot owners to increase their token generation by raiding other vulnerable plots for diamonds, which in turn can increase the amount of $FORGE tokens their plot generates.

<!-- Important points to keep in mind while staking a plot are: -->
We broke down the important takeaways here:

* If a plot is not staked, it is not modifiable in-game.

* If a plot is staked, it becomes modifiable by the verified owner.

* If a plot is staked and set as vulnerable by the owner, certain users are allowed to modify any blocks on the plot. See next point.

* Users are only able to modify vulnerable staked plots, if they themselves own at least one staked vulnerable plot.

* If a staked plot doesn't not contain any blocks of diamond, then it can not be made vulnerable.

<!-- * Access Granted for the owner to attack other vulnerable plots on the Server, in order to obtain more resources -->

* If a plot is staked and not set as vulnerable, it does not generate $FORGE Tokens.

* If a plot is staked and vulnerable, it can generate $FORGE tokens based off its rank.

* For each block of diamond located on the plot, the plot rank increments by 2.

<!-- * Additional token generation is dependant on amount of diamonds within the staked plot -->

* Rank is equal to the amount of $FORGE tokens it will generated per hour, if the plot is staked and set as vulnerable.
