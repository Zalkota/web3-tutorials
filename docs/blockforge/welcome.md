The BlockForge Team would like to thank the Critterz Development Team for the Inspiration to create a play-to-earn token with Minecraft Integration.

# About Us

 The Blockforge Development Team is affiliated with the original Cosmic Labs. We are a group of Engineers that are based in the Mid-West and have experience working in various Automotive and Tech Firms. The Blockforge Project is led by [Jukabo.eth](https://twitter.com/Jukabo_NFT) and [FeelinFroggy](https://twitter.com/FeelinFroggy__).

 BlockForge is the first on-chain NFT Minecraft P2E diamond battleground powered by the Ethereum Blockchain.
 The Goal for this project was to create a decentralized metaverse that is open for the general public to interact with. The Team also recognizes the importance of building a strong community and have therefore created an environment where every user shall be rewarded for their time spent within the Blockforge Universe with  $FORGE (ERC-20) Tokens.

 Minecraft was chosen as the platform to hose the Blockforge Universe. Minecraft is an ideal platform since it is widely available to the general public and already has a strong community for support.

 The Blockforge Team would like to thank everyone that has decided to be a part of this community. We thank you for your investment in us and understand the responsibility we hold to your investments.
 The Blockforge Team will ensure that we provide complete transparency with regards to the project roadmap, timeline and updates to keep community members engaged, involved and updated. We also guarantee that we will do everything we can to provide as much value to your time and investment.

# Risks :warning:

The BlockForge team is working very hard and diligently to create a Minecraft server that integrates Non-fungible Tokens (NFT) and crypto assets into its gameplay experience. However, there are many risks involved, both for the Blockforge team and users due to the nature of blockchain and cryptographic security. Here are some of the risks we currently want to bring to our users' attention:
* Mojang closes down our server for integrating blockchain technology.
* An unknown vulnerability in one of or Ethereum smart contracts could lead to a loss of users funds or the BlockForge team funds.
* In the case that not enough Battle Pass NFT are minted or a majority of development funds are stolen/lost, the BlockForge team will not be able to continue development and hosting the necessary server to run the Minecraft game server. It is in our best interest to not allow this to occur.


We are not responsible for your BlockForge NFTs or $FORGE tokens once they are inside your Ethereum wallet.

# Server Limitations

The server is currently limited to having only 256 players online at a time. The Blockforge Development team is working on creating a "no-limit" server where there is no cap on the max amount of players.
