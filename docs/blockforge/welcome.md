# About Us

 The Blockforge Development Team is affiliated with Cosmic Labs. We are a group of Engineers that are based in the Mid-West and have experience working in various Automotive and Tech Firms. The Blockforge Project is led by [Jukabo.eth](https://twitter.com/Jukabo_NFT) and [FeelinFroggy](https://twitter.com/FeelinFroggy__).

 The Goal for this project was to create a decentralized metaverse that is open for the general public to interact with. The Team also recognizes the importance of building a strong community and have therefore created an environment where every user shall be rewarded for their time spent within the Blockforge Universe with  $FORGE (ERC-20) Tokens.

 Minecraft was chosen as the platform to hose the Blockforge Universe. Minecraft is an ideal platform since it is widely available to the general public and already has a strong community for support.

 The Blockforge Team would like to thank everyone that has decided to be a part of this community. We thank you for your investment in us and understand the responsibility we hold to your investments.
 The Blockforge Team will ensure that we provide complete transparency with regards to the project roadmap, timeline and updates to keep community members engaged, involved and updated. We also guarantee that we will do everything we can to provide as much value to your time and investment.
