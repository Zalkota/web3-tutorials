# Battle Mode :dagger:
## Introduction

The Blockforge NFT Project is a decentralized, community-driven Play-To-Earn metaverse platform designed on Minecraft. Each NFT is a Play-To-Earn Pass that allows a user to earn $FORGE tokens in-game. $FORGE tokens can be used  to purchase plots of land(i.e. Territories) within BlockForge Minecraft Server.

## Requirements


#### To enable Battle Mode on a plot of land in the BlockForge Minecraft server, the following requirements must be met:</p>
* The minecraft account must be linked with BlockForge</h5>
* The plot must contain a minimum of 1 diamond block
* Ethereum wallet must contain a minimum of 1 Battle Pass NFT
* Ethereum wallet must contain a minimum of 1 plot NFT

## Plot Rank
Plots are given a rank number based on the amount of **Diamond Blocks** located on the plot. When the plot is staked and set to Battle Mode, then the plot will generate $FORGE tokens every hour, equal to the rank number multiplied by 2.
<!-- The plot must be staked and set to Battle Mode to generate $FORGE tokens.  -->
<!-- Plot rankings can affect the amount of tokens the plot can generate.  -->
<!-- A plot with a higher rank will generate more $FORGE tokens per day.  -->
Players can increase the rank of their land by placing diamond blocks on their plot. Once a staked plot contains at least one block of diamond, then it can be set to Battle Mode by the owner. When a staked plot is in Battle Mode, then it will generate $FORGE tokens for the owner.
