# $FORGE Token

 $FORGE is an ERC-20 token built on the Ethereum Blockchain that is used as the in-game currency for the Blockforge Universe. The purpose of the $FORGE token is to reward Blockforge Battle Pass Holders for their time and contribution to the society. The smart contract for $FORGE can be found [here](https://etherscan.io/address/0x807a0774236A0fBE9e7f8E7Df49EDFED0e6777Ea). The token will be scheduled for launch within the next few months for users to claim their rewards.


## Why Earn $FORGE ?

Earning $FORGE tokens will allow BlockForge Pass holders the ability to purchase plots of land within the Minecraft Server. Earning $FORGE tokens can be beneficial since there are only a limited amount of plots that can be purchased within the Minecraft Server.

$FORGE Tokens can also be used to trade in-game items within the Blockforge Universe. The development team plants to implement an in-game marketplace where $FORGE tokens can be used to transact. Holding $FORGE Tokens will also provide access to exclusive experiences, content and items within the BlockForge Universe.

Each Blockforge pass holder can claim their $FORGE tokens earned at any time from the Website Dashboard or the Token Smart Contract.


## Future Plans

The Development Team is also working creating more utility and value for $FORGE Tokens. We will update the community as the project progresses
