# Claiming Plots


The current map of Blockforge, name the Island of Karniel, is 10,240 x 10,240 blocks in size.  
The map of Blockforge is evenly divided into 6,400 unique plots of land. A plot is defined as an area of 128x128 blocks. BlockForge users can purchase multiple territories to expand their empire within the Universe. These plots can be purchased with the use of $FORGE Tokens. Plots are stored as an ERC-721 token on the Ethereum Blockchain. Plots can be staked by the owner of the ERC721 can then modify the plot.
