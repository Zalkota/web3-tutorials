# Purchasing Plots


100x100 blocks of land will be available for purchase within the BlockForge Minecraft Server. Each plot of land is referred to as a Territory. BlockForge Users can purchase multiple territories to expand their empire within the Universe. These Territories can be purchased with the use of $FORGE Tokens. Territories are stored as an ERC-721 token on the Ethereum Blockchain.

There will be 10,000 plots of land for purchase within each BlockForge world within the BlockForge Universe. The price of plots are dynamic and vary based on the number of plots that have already been sold. The price of the plot is calculated dynamically using the formula shown below:

## Plot Ranking
Plots are ranked based on the amount of “Diamond” it houses.  The higher the amount of “Diamond” ore present within a plot, the higher the rank. The rank of a plot is directly related to the amount of Diamond present within it.
Plot rankings can affect the amount of tokens the plot can generate. A plot with a higher rank will generate more $FORGE tokens per day. Players can increase the rank of their land by staking and opening it for vulnerability.


## Future Plans
The BlockForge Universe will include multiple worlds. Currently, plots will be available for purchase within the Island of Karniel World.
The development team is working on creating multiple worlds for users to explore, interact and claim territories.
