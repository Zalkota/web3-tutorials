# Project Scope

The Blockforge NFT Project is a decentralized, community-driven Play-To-Earn metaverse platform designed on Minecraft. Each NFT is a Play-To-Earn pass that allows a user to earn $FORGE tokens in-game. $FORGE tokens can be used  to purchase plots of land within BlockForge Minecraft Server.
The main features of ownership of a BlockForge Pass Include:


* Membership Access to earn $FORGE

* Access to generate $FORGE tokens by playing in the Minecraft Server

* Staking Access to allow purchase of land plot

  * Stakers can generate additional $FORGE tokens when in-game

  * Stakers can claim land plots with the use of $FORGE tokens

* Plot owners can generate additional $FORGE tokens when in-game

  * Plot owners can increase their in-game $FORGE generation by increasing the plot rank

  * Plot rank is determined based off the resources available within the plot

* Rent Pass to other players to help receive a share of their generated $FORGE

* Plot owners can rent their BlockForge pass to other players, and receive a share of the $FORGE tokens generated when the renter is in-game
