NPCs are spread out throughout the Island of Karniel in BlockForge.

## BlockForge Spawn

#### Dunstant The Blocksmith
We have modified certain blocks to have increased strength and durability. Use these blocks to fortify your defense and protect your Diamond Blocks from raiders. These blocks are redeemable with $Forge tokens from the blocksmith located inside BlockForge. Enter the main gate to BlockForge, travel down the stairs, first shop on the left. Speak with the NPC named Dunstan.
