# Introduction to the Defense of the Diamonds
BlockForge takes place on an island called Karniel. The world is 10,240 x 10,240 blocks and has a user spawn located at [-500, 150, -500]. The world is divided into 6,400 plots and each plot is 128x128 blocks in size. Plots will be claimable in exchange for $FORGE tokens; the cost of each plot is determined by the number of previously claimed plots. Plot owners have the ability to enable Battle Mode, which allows other users, who are also in battle mode, to attack their plot. In addition, the owner of the plot in battle mode generates $FORGE tokens equal to double the amount of Diamond Blocks located on their plot. The requirements to enable battle mode on a plot: ownership of a plot NFT, ownership of a Battle Pass NFT, and a minimum of 1 diamond block on the plot.

## Mission
The goal is simple, raid other users for their diamond blocks, while simultaneously defending the dimaonds on your plots. If you happen to need a break from waging war with your neighbor, then simply turn off battlemode, however it will come at the expense of your $FORGE token generation.
