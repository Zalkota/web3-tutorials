# Introduction to the Defense of the Diamonds
BlockForge takes place on an island called Karniel. The world is 10,240 x 10,240 blocks and has a user spawn located at [-500, 150, -500]. The world is divided into 6,400 plots and each plot is 128x128 blocks in size. Plots will be claimable in exchange for $FORGE tokens; the cost of each plot is determined by the number of previously claimed plots. Plot owners have the ability to enable Battle Mode, which allows other users, who are also in battle mode, to attack their plot. In addition, the owner of the plot in battle mode generates $FORGE tokens equal to double the amount of Diamond Blocks located on their plot. The requirements to enable battle mode on a plot: ownership of a plot NFT, ownership of a Battle Pass NFT, and a minimum of 1 diamond block on the plot.

<!-- A map of the Island can be found [here](https://map.blockforgenft.xyz/) -->




## Raiding
Raid other user plots for their diamond blocks, while simultaneously defending the dimaond ore and blocks on your plot. Diamond blocks will only generate $FORGE token when your land is in
[Battle Mode](/blockforge/Battle_Mode). Users are granted access to raid plots not owned by them, when both the user and plot are in [Battle Mode](/blockforge/Battle_Mode).
If you happen to need a break from waging war with your neighbor and generating tokens, then simply turn off battlemode.


## Block Fortification
We have modified certain blocks to have increased strength and durability. Use these blocks to fortify your defense and protect your Diamond Blocks from raiders.
