# Introduction to the Mercenary
Mecenarys can't build or destroy blocks, but they can attack any user in battle mode. 

## Defending
Raid other user plots for their diamond blocks, while simultaneously defending the dimaond ore and blocks on your plot. Diamond blocks will only generate $FORGE token when your land is in
[Battle Mode](/blockforge/Battle_Mode). Users are granted access to raid plots not owned by them, when both the user and plot are in [Battle Mode](/blockforge/Battle_Mode).
If you happen to need a break from waging war with your neighbor and generating tokens, then simply turn off battlemode.


## Plot Owner Bounty
We have modified certain blocks to have increased strength and durability. Use these blocks to fortify your defense and protect your Diamond Blocks from raiders.
