# Battle Pass NFT

The BlockForge Battle Pass NFT is an ERC721 Token that will be distributed via a public mint. Each Battle Pass NFT is unique, in that it will have a unique number on the front and a unique Minecraft skin on the back. Refer to the [Project Roadmap](/blockforge/Project_Timeline).


## Diamond Battle Pass

The Diamond Battle Pass NFT will be the first set of passes available for minting.
Owners of the NFT, will be able to download the Minecraft skin on our website. The NFT will allow access to the Blockforge Island of Karniel Minecraft Server, the ability to generate $FORGE tokens, enable Battle Mode on player owned and rented plots, and access to the Karniel Duel Arenas.

<!-- The Gold Pass will be scheduled for mint after the Diamond Battle Pass.  There will be a total of 4000 Gold Passes scheduled for minting. -->

Ownership of a Blockforge pass will allow the owner to earn roughly 15-25 $FORGE tokens per hour spent in-game. The amount of token that can be earned in-game depends on the type of pass that the owner possesses.

<!--
* In order to play on the Blockforge Minecraft server, you must own or rent at least one staked Battle pass.

* When a plot of land is made vulnerable (Battle Mode turned ON), then it will generate $FORGE tokens based on the amount of diamond blocks located on the plot. A battle pass must be owned be in the same wallet as the plot, in order to turn on plot Vulnerability.

* When a battle pass is staked and the owner is playing on the BlockForge Minecraft server, then it generates ~25 $FORGE tokens an hour for the player.
