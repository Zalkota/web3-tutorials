# Renting your Staked Battle Pass

BlockForge passes have to be staked in order to be rented out. When a BlockForge Pass is Staked, the Pass owner is granted access to rent their staked pass for a duration of 7 days to other players for use. The staked passes can be listed on a secondary market for sale or transfer for other players to rent out. Some important points to consider while renting your pass are:

* BlockForge Pass needs to be staked in order to obtain access to rent

* When you stake your pass, it is transferred to a staking contract and a new staked pass is minted to your Ethereum Address

* The staked pass can then be rented to other users

* Once Staked, the $FORGE token generation will be roughly 25-50 tokens per hour.

* This will remain the same even when the pass is rented out to other players for in-game use

* When a staked pass is rented out, it enters a 7 day lock-period

* Original owner will not be able to call back staked pass from the renter until the lock duration has elapsed

* Original owner will not be able to Unstake their pass until the lock duration has elapsed

* When a staked pass is rented out, The original owner gets 25% of the $FORGE tokens generated by the renter in-game. The rest of the tokens generated are awarded to the renter for their time spent in-game.

* When you transfer or sell a staked pass, the staked pass is automatically rented to the account it was sold or transferred to.

* After the lock-period expires, the original owner an revoke access from the renter to obtain their staked pass back or choose to unstake their BlockForge Pass
