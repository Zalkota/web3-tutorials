# Stake your BlockForge Battle Pass
BlockForge Pass Holders can stake their pass to obtain access to additional benefits mentioned below:
* Enable Hourly $FORGE token generation amount
* Obtain Access to rent your BlockForge Pass to other users

When a user stakes their BlockForge Pass, the pass is transferred to the staking contract for safe storage and a new staked pass is minted to the user. This staked pass token will have the same attributes as the original pass token, but will allow for higher in-game $FORGE generation and also unlock other features.


## Staking Rewards
By Staking your Blockforge pass, the first benefit you receive is the ability to generate $FORGE tokens per unit time spent in-game. Hourly earnings while in-game can range from roughly 25-50 tokens when a BlockForge pass is staked.  

The amount of $FORGE generated based off the time spent in-game when a user owns a  Staked “Gold Pass”  is calculated in the formula shown below:

   STAKED GOLD PASS $BLKFgenerated =Seconds played * 0.0042 $FORGE Tokens per second

The amount of $FORGE generated based off the time spent in-game when a user owns a  Staked “Diamond Pass”  is calculated in the formula shown below:

   DIAMOND PASS $BLKFgenerated =Seconds played * 0.0007 $FORGE Tokens per second  

A Staked BlockForge pass will also enable access for the pass owner to purchase 80x80 plots of land within the Minecraft Server using the $FORGE token they have earned while playing in-game.

Once a BlockForge Pass is staked, The owner will have the ability to rent their staked pass token to other players for a predefined amount of time.

## Unstaking your BlockForge Battle Pass

Owners can Unstake their BlockForge Pass at any time to obtain their original pass token back from the staking contract(where it was stored safely) and transfer back the staked pass token for burning
